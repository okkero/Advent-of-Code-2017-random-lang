## Crystal

### Time taken: 

40 minutes.

### Language Experience:

0 [See this link for explanation](https://github.com/okkero/Advent-of-Code-2017-random-lang/blob/master/README.md)

### Lessons learned:
A simple imperative language. The syntax reminds me a bit too much of Ruby and
Lua (end end end end end), which I am not particularly fond of. It does provide
some basic FP support, type inference, and it looks like there was some notion of
null safety in there as well, all of which is nice. To me, this language was
familiar and easy to pick up.
