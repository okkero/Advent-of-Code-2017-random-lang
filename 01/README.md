# Day 1
## OCaml

### Time taken: 

1 hour.

### Language Experience:

1 [See this link for explaination](https://github.com/okkero/Advent-of-Code-2017-random-lang/blob/master/README.md)

### Lessons learned:
Before I started today's challenge, I had the mindset that OCaml would be no
problem to pick up, given my experience with Haskell, another ML language.
While it wasn't too much of a hurdle, I had some moments of frustration when it
came to functional programming in OCaml. I found the stdlib to be considerably
lacking in FP support. For instance, I had to implement some pretty standard
functions myself (function composition, drop, take - to name a few), because they
were nowhere to be found in the stdlib. Also, no function to convert a string to
a list of chars???

All in all, not a terrible language, but not entirely my cup of tea.
